# Engagement Ring Design

## Description
A workable 3D design (STL file) for a ring with these properties. (I will have it printed and manufactured at a jeweler local to me)

- European Shank
- Low profile (avoid snagging)
- Solitaire stone
  - north/south set
  - 3/4ct princess cut (variations with 1ct princess, 3/4ct square cushion, and 1ct square cushion)
- Butterflies (see reference photos below):
  - Formed into the band itself, raised out as a relief (not a second part soldered on).
  - The relief should have some shape to it, with the tips of the winds being higher than where they connect to the body. The body and head section should also have some dimension/relief to them as well.
  - Ascending the band toward the solitaire, one on each side.
  - The shape of the butterflies should resemble, as closely as possible at this size, the **Eastern Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly (female)** species.
- Just above the butterflies small accent stones, under 2mm, round. I have 2 different heirloom diamonds which are very small. I forgot to get these measured for you, will try to this evening (Wednesday, February 11, eastern US time).
